/* 
- Mandelbrot set : OK
- Julia set
- zoom in and zoom out
- beautiful nice-looking color games to feel the depth of fratales
- display an image in the window : OK
- window managment should be runny : OK
- quit the porgram properly with ESC key press : OK
- same with the cros at the top of the window : OK
- use the minilibx images : OK

- implement another fractal (burnship, newton, buddhaabrot, etc);
- make sure the zoom effect follows the mouse position
- we can also move arround with the key arrows
- handle color shift

- smooth the color when the point is out of the set
- make gradient with every color (name ??)
- increase decrease precision
- julia set follwing the mouse and be able the stop with the space
- have a button to smooth the color shift
- have 10 palets of colors


TO do
- all the event handler work even for bonus
- make sur there are no leaks
- handle colorshift with the algo for color palettes
    -> algo to create any gradient
    -> make the interactive color shift
    -> when space is pressed stop the color shift
- smooth algorithm
- increase and decrease precision
- make the julia set
- julia set follwing the mouse and be able the stop with the space
- make other fractals
- have a good parsing
